Source: NIPS 2003 Feature Selection Challenge [IG05a]
Preprocessing: The data set is also available at UCI. Because the labels of testing set are not available, here we use the validation set (gisette_valid.data and gisette_valid.labels) as the testing set. The training data (gisette_train) are feature-wisely scaled to [-1,1]. Then the testing data (gisette_valid) are scaled based on the same scaling factors for the training data. These two scaled data sets are used in [GXY11a]
